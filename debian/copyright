    Hi,

    No problem, I understand that you have to be precise about these things.

    In which case I grant permission to *anyone* to use the code derived from
    Spreadsheet::WriteExcel.

    If that isn't sufficient then just agree a wording that you would all be
    happy with and I will give my blessing to it.

    John.

    SOFTWARE RIGHTS

    ANTLR 1989-2006 Developed by Terence Parr
    Partially supported by University of San Francisco & jGuru.com

    We reserve no legal rights to the ANTLR--it is fully in the
    public domain. An individual or company may do whatever
    they wish with source code distributed with ANTLR or the
    code generated by ANTLR, including the incorporation of
    ANTLR, or its output, into commercial software.

    We encourage users to develop software with ANTLR. However,
    we do ask that credit is given to us for developing
    ANTLR. By "credit", we mean that if you use ANTLR or
    incorporate any source code into one of your programs
    (commercial product, research project, or otherwise) that
    you acknowledge this fact somewhere in the documentation,
    research report, etc... If you like ANTLR and have
    developed a nice tool with the output, please mention that
    you developed it using ANTLR. In addition, we ask that the
    headers remain intact in our source code. As long as these
    guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this
    system and expect to make other tools available as they are
    completed.
